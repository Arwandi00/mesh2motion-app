# BVH (Biovision Hierarchy)
Widely used mocap file formats. It contains both the skeletal hierarchy and motion data. BVH files store rotation data for each bone in the skeleton, typically in Euler angles (e.g., XYZ or ZYX order). This seems to be more common in video game development so it is promising.
